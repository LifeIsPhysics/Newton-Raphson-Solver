# Motivation
In maths, science and engineering, we often come to a situation, where we need to find the root of a function.
One of the most standard problems in quantum mechanics is to solve for the energies of a mass particle 
inside a finite square well.
For this problem, there are no analytical solution
$$
\sqrt{10 - E_B} \tan{10 - E_B} = \sqrt{E_B} \quad (even) \\
\sqrt{10 - E_B} \cot{10 - E_B} = \sqrt{E_B} \quad (odd)
$$
